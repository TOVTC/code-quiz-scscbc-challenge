## Project status
Submitted 2022Mar20</br>
Note - additional commits made after March 20th represent further streamlining of code and do not fundamentally change the functional logic originally submitted. I became consumed with the idea of making a button generator/deletion function, and had to pursue my curiosity to its logical end - and I succeeded.
